volumeApology=Sorry! The ;;volume command has now been deprecated on the public music bot. This is because of how it causes the bot to spend a lot more time processing audio, some tracks up to 5 times more, causing everyone to hear stutter. By disabling this feature FredBoat can play much more music without lag.\
I recommend setting the bot''s volume via the dropdown menu https://fred.moe/1vD.png
